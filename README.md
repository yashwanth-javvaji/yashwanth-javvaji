I am a graduate student studying computer science at The University of Texas at Dallas with a focus on web development and data science. I'm now seeking for internship and full-time positions to broaden my professional experience.

I have about 10 months of software development internship experience. I am skilled in C++, Python, and JavaScript. I have worked on web-based applications using the latest web technologies. I am a specialist in UI & UX Design and in developing customer service-oriented applications with solid test automation strategies. In the past, I have worked on projects using MERN stack, Flask, and DevOps tools.

I have a lot of expertise with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and several open-source frameworks, including Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Angular and MongoDB. I am proficient in using these frameworks to create web apps with Single Page Applications (SPA) architectures. I can create sophisticated SQL queries utilizing well-known database servers like MySQL. In addition to my development work, I have strong problem-solving and bug-fixing abilities.

In addition to my skills in coding, I also worked as a placement coordinator. In this role, I was in charge of arranging placement-related tasks such as contacting human resources, providing guidance to students, responding to their emails, and gathering and storing student data to aid the placements team.
